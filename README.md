Sleep and Income Correlation Analysis

Project Overview
This repository contains code and data for a group analytics project that aims to determine if there is a correlation between sleep patterns and income across different age groups. The project utilizes various data analysis techniques to explore this relationship and draw meaningful insights.

Data Sources

•	Sleep data: [https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w23]

•	Income data: [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html]



Project Structure:

The project is organized as follows:

Data
Notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks are provided to showcase the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
Results/: This directory stores visualizations, summaries, and findings from the analysis.
README.md – This file provides an overview of the project and key findings. 


Dependencies

The following Python libraries were used for this project: 

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy and Seaborn

Key Findings

After analyzing the date, the following key findings were observed:

1. Across all age groups and all years, men earned a higher income than women despite mean and women getting rlatively equal amounts of sleep.
   
2. Age group 45-54 were the highest earners and got the least amount of sleep on average.

3. Age group 15-24 were the lowest earners out of all groups and they get the most sleep on average.
   
4. Age group 65 and older placed 2nd in average hours of sleep and were the second lowest earners.
   
Conclusion

After conducting our analysis, it has been determined that sleep duration did not have an influence on annual income but overall there seems to be a weak negative correlation between sleep duration and income levels.
