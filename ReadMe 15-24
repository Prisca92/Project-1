The bar charts and scatter plots aim to examine the relationship between annual income and sleep by gender from 2003 to 2017 for individuals between the ages 15-24. On average this group of individuals received an average of 9.3 hours of sleep per day.Hours slept per day over the duration of 15 years for the most part remained consistent when looking at both genders. When comparing females to males, females received more sleep than males but also had a lower annual income. This group presented to be the lowest earners while getting the most sleep compared to the other age groups. To further examine and check for any correlation a linear regression was conducted to measure average annual income and average hours of sleep. The r-value is:0.23764864816797043 which shows no correlation.
